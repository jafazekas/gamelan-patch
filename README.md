Electronic Gamelan Music

Electronic Studio Techniques II Project: Traditional Javanese Gamelan tuning systems and pitched gongs meet Messiaen inspired Tala rhythms in overlapping loops. To play, either press the keys on the keyboard to 'hit' the gongs and trigger loops, or simply press the spacebar to automate the piece. 

Coded in MaxMSP using recorded Gamelan sounds. This is the solo version. It is currently a work in progress, for modification into an ensemble piece.
